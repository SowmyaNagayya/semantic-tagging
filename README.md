# Homework 1: semantic-tagging

## objectives
 
The objective of assignment is to go through the given homework code and refactor it by adding semantic tags<> and some missed id tag for search-engine-optimization. So, i changed in title name,and semantics tags like header, nav, section, aside, article, footer and adding alt attribute for img tag after updating in index.html. I had changed in style.css by adding nav instead of div in .header(class). So, when we run the code it should work properly.
